        <h2>Will there be judging?</h2>
        <p>
        For the 2017 Science Fair we have decided to eliminate the judging portion of the fair. We <b>will</b> be inviting
        guests from our community to the event who have a STEAM background, so you should continue to practice presenting
        your projects as if you were being judged (we'll give some pointers on that).
        </p>
        <p>
        All students participating in the Science Fair will be recognized with a certificate of achievement.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I work with a partner?</h2>

        <p><b>YES!</b> For the first time in many years we will allow students to work with one additional partner
          on a project. This had been discontinued for two reasons. It made the judging process more difficult and
          it is also logistically challenging for some students. If you are signing up with a partner, make sure you
          have enough time to work together on the project!
        </p>

        <h2>Do I have to do an experiment, or can I research and explain an interesting topic?</h2>

        <p>Both research projects and experimental projects are acceptable.</p>

        <p>If you choose to do a research project, consider doing something to
        supplement your research, such as building a model or conducting a survey.  For
        example, if you want to study how highway accidents are related to driving habits, you
        could survey drivers about the speed they drive, whether they wear seatbelts, and
        whether they eat or talk on the phone while driving.  Share your survey results as part of
        your display!
      </p>

      <h2>Can an adult help me with my project?</h2>

      <p>Yes.  In fact, an adult should help you with any part of your project that requires
      supervision.  However, you should do as much of your project on your own as you can -
      especially your display board.
    </p>

      <h2>What should my display look like?</h2>

      <p>Your handbook includes ideas about what your display should include.  Most
      importantly, your display should be neat and organized, and should focus on the
      important aspects of your project.  Be creative - use artwork or pictures to make it
      interesting to review.  Do not forget to put your name, project title, and grade on the
      front of your display!
      </p>

        <h2>I still have a question!</h2>

        <p>Let us know and we'll answer it for you! E-mail it to
            (<a href="mailto:#">joshabell@gmail.com</a>). </p>
