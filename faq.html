        <h2>Can I work with a partner?</h2>

        <p>We are not allowing partner projects in the 2016 Science Fair.</p>

        <h2>Do I have to do an experiment, or can I research and explain an interesting topic?</h2>

        <p>Both research projects and experimental projects are acceptable.</p>

        <p>However, over the past several years, we have observed that the judges tend
        to prefer projects that are  experimental  <u>or include data-gathering beyond
        what you would find in the library or on the Internet</u>. </p>

        <p>If you choose to do a research project, consider doing something to
        supplement your research, such as building a model or conducting a survey.  For
        example, if you want to study how highway accidents are related to driving habits, you
        could survey drivers about the speed they drive, whether they wear seatbelts, and
        whether they eat or talk on the phone while driving.  Share your survey results as part of
        your display!
      </p>

      <h2>Can an adult help me with my project?</h2>

      <p>Yes.  In fact, an adult should help you with any part of your project that requires
      supervision.  However, you should do as much of your project on your own as you can -
      especially your display board.
    </p>

      <h2>What should my display look like?</h2>

      <p>Your handbook includes ideas about what your display should include.  Most
      importantly, your display should be neat and organized, and should focus on the
      important aspects of your project.  Be creative - use artwork or pictures to make it
      interesting to review.  Do not forget to put your name, project title, and grade on the
      front of your display!
      </p>

      <h2>What will happen when the judges review my project?</h2>

      <p>You will meet with one judge the afternoon of the fair. The judge will ask you to
      explain your project and what you learned.</p>

      <p>The judges are interested in learning about your project, including
      the research you completed and the experiments you conducted. Important judging
      elements include the quality of your display and how well you can explain your project. </p>

      <h2>What do I do while Iâ€™m waiting to be judged? </h2>

      <p>Everyone is required to stay in the gym while waiting to be judged. There will be chairs set up where you can sit.
      No one should be walking around looking at the projects during judging.  Please bring homework or a book to
      read, or another quiet activity. </p>

        <h2>I still have a question!</h2>

        <p>Let us know and we'll answer it for you! E-mail it to
            (<a href="mailto:#">joshabell@gmail.com</a>). </p>
