# Research Projects

For a research project, your goal is to learn facts about your topic and share those facts in an interesting and comprehensive display. Your research display can include: information from the internet and the library, graphics, comparisons, displays of charts and graphs, statistics from conducting a survey, a demonstration, a model, samples, or collections.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a sample of a research based project:

> Megan loves collecting crystals! She is fascinated about them and has quite a collection.
    She wants to display her collection while demonstrating that she has learned something new about them.
    She decides to ask the question, *"What are some common crystals?"*

>  Megan will then walk through the following steps to complete her project:

>  A. Read books about crystals, investigating what is common and not so common.

>  B. Research using the internet and find some interesting photographs of really neat crystals. Then she draws some formations herself.

>  C. Try growing common crystals.

>  D. Complete her collection so that she has both a polished and rough specimen of each crystal. This will let her ask the judges to try and pair up the matching crystals.

>  E. Provide general information about each crystal.

>  F. Find an interesting way to proudly display her collection and project.

Keep in mind not all research based projects have collections.
