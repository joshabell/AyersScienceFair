## Four Easy Steps!

### Step 1 : Choose a Topic

Science is the study of the world around us and the universe beyond.  The topics are endless! Most important when choosing a topic is to pick something that is really interesting to you.

To pick the perfect topic for you, check out science books from the library, talk to adults you know that work in the science field or that just love science.  If you have a computer and internet access, use the website list provided to delve into the endless options.

**Always get a guardian’s permission to use the internet.**

### Step 2 : Create Your Project

Once you have selected your topic, the real fun begins.  Your project can be a
**research** based project, or an **experimental** project.

### Step 3 : Prepare Your Presentation

Once your project is complete, it’s time to show your work to the judges and your classmates.  At the Science Fair, participants will be given a three-foot wide, two-foot deep space on a table for project display.  There needs to be enough room for all the displays, so please do not make yours any wider than three feet wide, two-foot deep.

Also, remember that participants cannot be guaranteed the availability of an electrical outlet.  Avoid using AC power for your display (batteries are acceptable).

Many participants also build models or display parts of their experiments on the table in front of their poster displays.  If you took notes or used a journal, you could put your notebook or journal on display!  

Don’t forget to put your name, grade and a title on the front of your display board!

### Step 4 : Present Your Project

At the fair, you will present your project to a judge, and other people may ask
you questions about your project at the science fair.

Practice presenting your project to family and friends before the fair!
