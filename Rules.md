<b>Batteries are allowed</b>.

## Animal projects

Animal study projects would maintain a respect for all living things.  For this Science Fair, the following rules apply:

1. No vertebrate animal studies are allowed except for observations of animals in their natural environment (for example, wild animals in the wild, zoo animals in  the zoo, pets around the house).  Vertebrate animals include people, dogs, cats,
hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, rats, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and similar animals.
2. No projects are allowed that might inflict pain or injury to the animals under observation.
3. Small Animals are allowed on display. The animal must be caged or contained.  The cage must be small enough to fit on the allotted space for your project. Please no animals larger than a guinea pig, and no cats or dogs on leashes.
4. Live animals must be taken home after the evening of the fair cannot be displayed during the classroom visits.

Please contact the Ayers Science Fair chair if you have questions about any of these rules!
