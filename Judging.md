# Judging

All projects are reviewed by a panel of judges from the community and students
will meet individually with a judge.

All students will receive written comments from the judges.  

The judges will complete a form focused on the following:

 * **Understanding** – How well do you understand your topic?

 * **Research Methods** – For research projects, did you conduct thorough research
 to explain your topic in detail?

 * **Scientific Method** – For experimental projects, did you follow a scientific method,
   including making observations, developing a hypothesis, testing the  hypothesis
   and analyzing results?

 * **Originality** – How creative is your work? Did you pick a unique topic or find an unusual or creative way to explore a common topic?

 * **Presentation** – What is the quality of your display? It is neat with sufficient detail to show your work?

 * **Communication** - How well do you communicate your topic to the judges?  Can you explain your project, including the experiments you preformed and the results of those experiments?
