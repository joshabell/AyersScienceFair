# Experiment Projects

Use the Scientific Method for Experimental Projects.

Here is a sample of an experimental project:

> Alexander is really curious about how batteries work. After doing some initial research, he decides to do an Experimentation science fair project - one that requires an experiment and one that expects him to follow all six steps of the Scientific Method.

> A. Alexander asks the question, *"Can I create my own battery?"*

> B. He researches the components of a battery and learns all about positive electrons, negative electrons, circuits, current flow.

> C. He creates a hypothesis. In this case, he hypothesizes that he can create a battery using lemons, zinc, copper, and wires.

> *“I believe I can make a battery using lemon, zinc, copper and wires.”*

> D. To test his hypothesis, he sets up an experiment using the materials listed in his hypothesis. In this case, copper metal, zinc metal, wires, alligator clips, lemons and a small LED.

> E. Alexander's initial experiment fails. He analyzes his experiment and his research and decides that he used insufficient zinc and copper. After adding more, he lights the LED.

> F. Alexander concludes that his hypothesis was correct and demonstrates how to create your own battery.
